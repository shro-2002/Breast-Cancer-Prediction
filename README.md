# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

Women are seriously threatened by breast cancer with high morbidity and mortality. The lack of robustprognosis models results in difficulty for doctors to prepare a treatment plan that may prolong patient survivaltime. Hence, the requirement of time is to develop the technique which gives minimum error to increase accuracy. Two algorithm SVM and KNN which predict the breast cancer outcome have been compared for a single dataset.
